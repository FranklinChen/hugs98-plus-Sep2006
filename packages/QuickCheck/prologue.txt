A library for testing Haskell programs automatically. The programmer provides a
specification of the program, in the form of properties which functions should
satisfy, and QuickCheck then tests that the properties hold in a large number of
randomly generated cases. Specifications are expressed in Haskell, using
combinators defined in the QuickCheck library. QuickCheck provides combinators
to define properties, observe the distribution of test data, and define test
data generators. For more information, please see:
