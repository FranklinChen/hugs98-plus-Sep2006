The @OpenGL@ package contains a Haskell binding for the OpenGL graphics system
(GL, version 1.5) and its accompanying utility library (GLU, version 1.3).
OpenGL is the industry\'s most widely used and supported 2D and 3D graphics
application programming interface (API), incorporating a broad set of rendering,
texture mapping, special effects, and other powerful visualization functions.
