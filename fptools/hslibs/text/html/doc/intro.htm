<P
    >
This is the first release of the Haskell Html combinators.
(Version 0.1)</P
    >

<P
    >Using HTML is a great way of displaying structured data, allowing
neat presentation using tricks like boxing, color, fonts and
indentation levels.  This library is a collection of combinators,
allowing your Haskell programs to generate HTML.</P
    >

This release has
<UL
    >
<LI
      >Full support for HTML 3.2, which is 
the version of HTML supported by most browsers.
</LI
      >
<LI
      >An HTML DSL language. 
Overloaded combinators are used to allow clean specification
of your HTML text.
</LI
      >
<LI
      >Special support for generating tables.
</LI
      >
<LI
      >Tree displaying functions, where depth is 
represented by indentation of tables.
</LI
      >
<LI
      >Debugging functions, that let you view your HTML,
    as explicit nested structures.
</LI
      >
</UL
    >

<P
    > We also have a <A HREF = "License"
      >LICENSE</A
      > and copyright to
protect the truly paranoid.  I've used these modules for several
months now, and find them very useful. I hope you do too.</P
