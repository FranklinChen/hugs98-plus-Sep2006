  * New upstream release
    - More of the hierarchical libraries, including imprecise exceptions
      and unboxed arrays, giving greater compatibility with GHC.
      For now, compatibility with the old libraries is provided by stub
      modules, but users are encouraged to migrate to the new libraries.
    - The Double type is now double-precision on most architectures.
    - The -e, -f, -i, -N, -W and -X options are gone, as is the :project
      command.
    - Integrated .NET support (on Windows).
    - The beginnings of a User's Guide (still somewhat incomplete).
    - Numerous bug fixes since the previous major release in Nov 2002.
  * Control
    - Removed depends on hugs-doc
    - Removed pre-depends on autoconf (where did this come from?) (Closes: #211444)
    - Added build-depends on docbook-utils
    - Updated standards-version
  * Rules
    - Improvements in the upstream Makefile cause some cleanup
    - fix for configure line (Closes: #208363)
    - Changed strip rule for new binaries
    - Added gzip for new haskell-pkg man page
    - Removed mkdir of (unused) /usr/share/hugs98 (Closes: #197554)
  * Misc
    - added -Wall to CFLAGS to conform to standards version 3.5.7.0
