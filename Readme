   We are pleased to announce a new release of Hugs98, an interpreter
   and programming environment for developing Haskell programs.

   In addition to numerous bug fixes, changes since the interim release
   in March 2005 include:

   - The default current module is now the empty module Hugs.
   - Compatibility libraries are present, but no longer included on the
     default search path.  They will be removed in the next release.
   - Rewritten graphical Windows interface (contributed by Neil Mitchell).

   Further changes since the last major release in November 2003 include:

   - The Char type and the Char module now support Unicode as specified
     in the Haskell 98 Report (contributed by Dmitry Golubovsky).
   - The new -X option groups several options into one argument.
   - The syntax of the ffihugs command has changed: the +G and +L options
     are gone, and a new +i option can be used to specify include files.
   - Hugs now has basic support for Cabal.

   The home page for Hugs is at http://haskell.org/hugs.
