The foldr2/right rule isn't exactly right, because it changes
the strictness of foldr2 (and thereby zip)

E.g. main = print (null (zip nonobviousNil (build undefined)))

                  f n = if n == 0 then [] else f (n-1)

I'm going to leave it though.

Common up near identical calls to `error' to reduce the number
constant strings created when compiled:

\begin{code}
errorEmptyList :: String -> a
errorEmptyList fun =
  error (prel_list_str ++ fun ++ ": empty list")

prel_list_str :: String
prel_list_str = "Prelude."
\end{code}
