#line 1 "text"
Here is some ordinary text with embedded Haskell-ish constructs,
that should however /not/ be interpreted as Haskell if the --text
option is given to cpphs.  For instance, here is a Haskell comment
including a cpp definition: {-

and now we end the comment: -}   and try out the definition:  bar
Likewise, double and single quotes no longer delimit strings or chars: "

and what do we have here?: "  ' bar  '


Also, in text-mode, macros should be expanded inside Haskell comments:
    -- Some text including this, the other, and that.
and strings "Some text including this, the other, and that.".
