Some tests for the Haskell Graphics Library.

HelloWorld: displays 2 strings, exits on a key press&release.

Tests: four tests:
    "Test"
	prompts for keypress
	keypresses step through outlines: white square,
		white diamond + red triangle, white diamond,
		white pentagon, empty
	then exits

    "Animation"
	prompts for keypress
	keypresses step through white outline polygons, up to 20 sides
	then exits

    "Font demo"
	"Font Test1" in square Courier, red, rotated (Win32 only)
	"Font Test2" in Lucida italic, blue on green, rotated (Win32 only)
	exits on left mouse button press

    "Font demo 2"
	displays 9 texts with different alignments relative to points
	exits on a left mouse button press

GTest: a bunch of tests:

    "My First Graphics Program":
	displays text
	waits for a left mouse button press
	prompts for 2 keypresses and then exits

    "My Second Graphics Program"
	displays text
	waits for a right mouse button press
	prompts for 2 keypresses and then exits

    "Regions demo"
	draws 4 monochrome pictures, stepped with left mouse button presses
	prompts for a keypress and then exits

    "Multiwindow demo 1"+"Multiwindow demo 2"
	displays text in each window
	prompts for a keypress in each window and then exits

    "Picture demo"
	draws picture in red, green and blue on black background
	waits for a left mouse button press
	prompts for a keypress and then exits

    "Animation demo"
	rotating red&green picture, stepped with left mouse button presses
	freezes after 21 steps

    "Timer demo"
	the same animation as above, but on a timer

    "Font demo"
	"Font Test1" in square Helvetica, red, rotated (Win32 only)
	"Font Test2" in Times italic, blue on green, rotated (Win32 only)
	exits on left mouse button press

    "Error recovery demo"
	left mouse button press does error "foo1"

    "My First Incremental Graphics Program"
	starts with a red diagonal line
	mouse button clicks add red lines to the picture
	you can also draw by dragging
