\subsection{Portability notes}

\begin{itemize}
\item \NotInX{\fun{polyBezier}}
\item \fun{shearEllipse} is implemented by polygons on both Win32 and X11.
\item X11 does not directly support font rotation so \fun{mkFont}
always ignores the rotation angle argument in the X11 implementation
of this library.

\item Many of the font families typically available on Win32 are not
available on X11 (and {\it vice-versa\/}).  In our experience, the
font families ``courier,'' ``helvetica'' and ``times'' are somewhat
portable.
\item
  On Win32, the pen is also used to draw a line round all
  the filled shapes --- so the pen color also affects how
  polygons, ellipses and regions are drawn.

\item
  One of the Win32 ``gotchas'' is that the choice of \type{Style}
  only applies if the width is 1 or less.  With greater widths,
  the pen style will always be \fun{Solid} no matter what you try to
  select.  This problem does not apply to X11.
\item The Bitmap functions are not currently provided in the X11
implementation of this library.
\item \fun{shearBitmap} is supported on Win'NT but not Win'95.
\item \NotInWin{\fun{emptyRegion}}
It is possible to use an empty rectangle region instead
\item \fun{ellipseRegion} is implemented using polygons in the X11
implementation of the library.
\item
  Programmers should assume that the \type{Event} datatype will be extended in the
  not-too-distant future and that individual events may change slightly.
  As a minimum, you should add a ``match anything'' alternative to
  any function which pattern matches against \type{Event}s.

\item
X11 systems typically have three button mice.  Button 1 is used as the
left button, button 3 as the right button and button 2 (the middle
button) is ignored.

\end{itemize}
