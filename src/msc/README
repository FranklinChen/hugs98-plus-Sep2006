How to build Hugs with Microsoft Visual C++
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We used to do this using a pure Microsoft environment (.bat files, DOS
command windows, etc.) and that all ought to still work but we don't
do things that way anymore so we can't provide accurate information on
how to do it.  

These days, we often build using a Cygwin environment to provide the
shell and Microsoft's Visual C++ compiler (using in batch mode) and NMake
to compile Hugs.


1) Put this in your .bashrc (or whatever you use)

VSCommonDir="/cygdrive/c/program files/microsoft visual studio/common"
MSDevDir="/cygdrive/c/program files/microsoft visual studio/common/msdev98"
MSVCDir="/cygdrive/c/program files/microsoft visual studio/vc98"

export PATH="$MSDevDir/bin:$MSVCDir/bin:$VSCommonDir/tools/win95:$VSCommonDir/tools:$PATH"

export VSCommonDir="C:\\PROGRA~1\\MICROS~3\\COMMON"
export MSDevDir="C:\\PROGRA~1\\MICROS~3\\COMMON\\msdev98"
export MSVCDir="C:\\PROGRA~1\\MICROS~3\\VC98"
export INCLUDE="$MSVCDir\\ATL\\INCLUDE;$MSVCDir\\INCLUDE;$MSVCDir\\MFC\\INCLUDE;$INCLUDE"
export LIB="$MSVCDir\\LIB;$MSVCDir\\MFC\\LIB;$LIB"


2) Put configure-generated files in the right place:

   cd hugs98/src
   cp msc/{Makefile,config.h,options.h} .

3) Build using nmake  (_not__ GNU make)

   nmake

4) Copy into directory above and test

   cp *.exe ..
   ../hugs

At the moment, there's no story for running convert_libraries and
friends when doing a build like this.  (Probably easy but I haven't
done it so I can't document it.)
