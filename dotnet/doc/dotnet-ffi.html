<h1>Accessing .NET via the FFI</h1>

<p>
Access to .NET functionality is provided via Haskell's 
<a href="http://haskell.org/definition/">FFI declarations</a>.
For example, to use the .NET Framework's static method
for looking up environment variables, you'd write the following FFI
declaration:

<pre>
module Env where
import Dotnet

foreign import dotnet
  "static System.Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable"
  getEnv :: String -> IO String
</pre>

<p>
It declares the IO action <tt>getEnv</tt> which given the name of
an environment variable will look it up by calling
<tt>System.Environment</tt>'s static method. The result is whatever
the variable maps to, or the empty string if the variable isn't
present in the environment block.

<p>
<tt>getEnv</tt> is bound to its .NET method via a specification
string. The qualifier, <tt>static</tt>, indicates that we're
binding to a static method; the second part gives the fully
qualified name of the static method we're binding to. To tell the FFI
implementation that we're accessing .NET code, the <tt>dotnet</tt>
calling convention qualifier is used (and required.)

<p>
Along with the specification string goes the Haskell type given
to the method. Clearly, this type has to be <em>compatible</em> with
the corresponding .NET type. If not, method invocation will
fail and a Haskell IO exception is raised.

<p>
Binding isn't limited to methods; to access a field you'd
write the following:

<pre>
module Math where
import Dotnet

foreign import dotnet
  "static field System.Math.PI"
  piVal :: Double
</pre>

<p>
which binds <tt>piVal</tt> to the value of the static
field <tt>System.Math.PI</tt> -- making the (quite reasonable!)
assumption that the value is indeed constant. If it hadn't
been constant, giving <tt>piVal</tt> the type <tt>(IO Double)</tt>
would have been more appropriate.

<p>
The above FFI declaration uses the <tt>field</tt> qualifier in its
specification string to indicate that we're binding to a field
and not a method. The Hugs98.net implementation looks at the
result type of a declaration using <tt>field</tt> to determine whether
the field access is a read or write operation. If the result is of
the form <tt>(IO ())</tt> (or <tt>()</tt)), a field 'setter' is being
defined; anything else is a field 'getter' (like <tt>piVal</tt> above.)
For instance, to provide a way to update the <tt>PI</tt> field:

<pre>
foreign import dotnet
  "static field System.Math.PI"
  setPiVal :: Double -> IO ()
</pre>

<p>
This will actually fail should you attempt to use it, as the field is
read-only, but demonstrates how to use an FFI declaration to provide
field update functions.

<h2>Creating and representing objects</h2>

<p>
Object constructors are accessed along similar lines:

<pre>
foreign import dotnet
  "ctor System.Object"
  newObject :: IO (Object a)
</pre>

<p>
The <tt>ctor</tt> in the specification string signals that we're
binding to a constructor; in this case the default constructor for 
<tt>System.Object</tt>. Object references are represented using
the type <tt>Object</tt>. It is parameterised over the type of the
class the reference is an instance of. This typed representation of 
object references lets us use the standard 'trick' of encoding
single-inheritance object type hierarchies:

<pre>
-- System.Xml.XmlNode
data XmlNode_ a
type XmlNode a = Object (XmlNode_ a)

-- System.Xml.XmlDocument; sub-class of XmlNode
data XmlDocument_ a
type XmlDocument a = XmlNode (XmlDocument_ a)

-- System.Xml.XmlDataDocument; sub-class of XmlDocument
data XmlDataDocument_ a
type XmlDataDocument a = XmlDocument (XmlDataDocument_ a)

obj1 :: XmlDataDocument () -- a reference to an instance of XmlDataDocument
obj2 :: XmlNode a  -- a reference to an object that's at least an XmlNode.

</pre>

<p>
This nesting of the inheritance chain in the type argument helps
preserve type safety in Haskell:

<pre>
foreign import dotnet
  "method System.Xml.XmlDocument.Load"
  load :: String{-URL-} -> XmlDocument a -> IO ()
</pre>

<p>
The <tt>this</tt> pointer is here constrained to be <tt>(Object
(XmlNode (XmlDocument_ a))</tt>, i.e., it needs to at least implement
<tt>System.Xml.XmlDocument</tt>, which precisely captures the
type constraint on the method.

<p>
Clearly this is all dependent on the user being precise when encoding
the class hierarchies using types like in the above example. To
help writing out FFI declarations and give these appropriate Haskell
types, the hugs98.net distribution comes with a tool,
<tt>hswrapgen</tt>, for generating FFI declarations and object types
for a .NET class (see <tt>dotnet/tools</tt> in the distribution.)

<p>
To return to the above FFI declaration, it also demonstrates how to
bind to non-static methods. Apart from using the <tt>method</tt>
qualifier in the specification string, method bindings take the
'this' pointer as their last argument. This is so that you can
write OO-looking code using the <tt>(#)</tt> from the <tt>Dotnet</tt>
library:

<pre>
createDoc url = do
  d <- newDoc 
  d # load url
  return d
</pre>

<p>
So given the above declaration along with:

<pre>
foreign import dotnet
  "ctor System.Xml.XmlDocument"
  newDoc :: IO (XmlDocument ())
</pre>

<p>
you're all set to manipulate XML documents. Notice the type argument
to <tt>XmlDocument</tt> for the constructor, <tt>()</tt>, capturing
the fact that the constructor is returning a specific instance.

<p>
One final word on constructors; binding to parameterised constructors
is straightforward also:

<pre>
foreign import dotnet
  "ctor System.Drawing.Icon"
  newIcon :: String -> IO (Icon ()) 
     -- assuming you've defined the Icon object type.
</pre>

<h2>FFI summary</h2>

<p>
The .NET <tt>foreign import</tt> declarations have the following
form:

<pre>
ffidecl : ...
        | 'foreign' 'import' 'dotnet'
	      "spec-string" varName '::' ffiType

spec-string : ('static')? 
              ('field'|'ctor'|'method')?
	      ('[' assemblyName ']')?
	      .NETName

ffiType : PrimType -> ffiType
        | IO PrimType
	| PrimType

PrimType = standard FFI types + Object a + String
</pre>

<p>
i.e., a standard <tt>foreign import</tt> in Haskell, but with
a specification string that lets you unambiguously declare what
.NET entity that's being <em>imported</em> / bound to. The first
two (optional) entries in the specification string qualifies
what kind of entity we're binding to. If they're both omitted,
this is equivalent to using <tt>method</tt>.

<p>
By default, the hugs98.net implementation will consult the .NET
'standard' assemblies (i.e., assemblies installed in the same
directory as your copy of <tt>mscorlib.dll</tt>) when attempting to
bind to the .NET entity. If its class is part of some other assembly,
you may prefix the fully-qualified class name with the name of the 
assembly,

<pre>
foreign import dotnet
  "static [foo.dll]Foo.bar"
  bar :: Int -> IO Int
</pre>

<p>
Assuming <tt>foo.dll</tt> can be located by the .NET run-time via its
assembly search path, <tt>foo.dll:Foo.bar</tt> can now be accessed.

<p>
The range of types supported as arguments to and results of
<tt>foreign import</tt>ed .NET entities are those of the Haskell FFI,
but extended with support for both passing and returning .NET object
references (<tt>Object</tt>) together with Haskell strings.
