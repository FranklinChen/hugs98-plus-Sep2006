Hugs for EPOC
-------------

Hugs for EPOC should be built with the Symbian SDK. This directory contains
all the necessary files; after unpacking the source, copy config.h,
options.h and hugs.mmp into src/ and then, after copying the hugs98
directory into C:\epoc_code, an incantation of the form

makmake hugs.mmp {marm,winc}

should make a makefile which you can then use with

nmake -f hugs.{marm,winc}

If you're using MS VC++ 6.0 introductory edition, you should uncomment the
section at the end of hugs.mmp which contains a hack to make things work.

To get a slightly smaller ARM build, edit the hugs.marm file and change the
-O flag in CFLAGS to -O2. By default, Hugs for EPOC is built without the
Hugs extensions; change HASKELL_98_ONLY to 0 in options.h to stop that.

The remainder of the files are for building a SIS installation file
(demos_readme, eshell_readme, hugs.pkg, readme; you also need the file
License from the root of the hugs tree for this).

Good luck, and please pester Reuben or Glenn with questions about building,
and, in the first instance, for bugs (which are likely to be ours rather
than Hugs's).
