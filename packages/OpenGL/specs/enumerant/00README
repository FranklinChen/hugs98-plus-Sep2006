* ConvertEnumSpec.hs:

  A converter for the transformation of OpenGL enumerant spec files into Haskell
  data types, including (un)marshaling functions.


* EBNF.txt:

  An LL(1) grammar for enumerant spec files in ISO Extended BNF. The LL(1)
  property has been checked with the RDP parser generator, see

* enum.spec:

  An OpenGL 1.3 enumerant specification, including extensions. This is a heavily
  modified version of the SI's enum.spec (rev. 1.3), cf.

     http://oss.sgi.com/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/projects/ogl-sample/main/gfx/include/gl/spec/enum.spec?rev=1.3


* enumglu.spec:

  An almost unmodified GLU 1.3 spec straight from the SI (rev. 1.1), see:

     http://oss.sgi.com/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/projects/ogl-sample/main/doc/registry/specs/enumglu.spec?rev=1.1

  The only change was making "Version" a "define" instead of an "enum".
