CHANGES (FGL/HASKELL, Version: June 2006)
--------------------------------------------

June 2006
---------
* fixed a bug in findP (thanks to lnagy@fit.edu)
* added function delLEdge in Graph.hs (thanks to Jose Labra)
* changed implementation of updFM and mkGraph (thanks to Don Stewart)


February 2005
-------------
* fixed an import error in Basic.hs 
* removed Eq instance of gr because it caused overlapping instance problems.
  Instead the function equal defined in Graph.hs can be used
* added some more functions to the export list of DFS.hs
* changed the definition of LPath into a newtype to avoid
  overlapping instances with lists
* fixed the Makefile (for GHC and GHCi)


January 2004
------------
* bug fix for nearestNode (src/Data/Graph/Inductive/Query/GVD.hs)
Update contributed by Aetion Technologies LLC (www.aetion.com)
* Refactor into hierarchical namespace
* Build changes:
  - build a standard haskell library (libHSfgl.a, HSfgl.o)
  - install as ghc package (fgl), uses Auto so no -package is needed
* Automatic Node generation for labels: Data.Graph.Inductive.NodeMap
* Graphviz output: Data.Graph.Inductive.Graphviz


September 2002
--------------
* Introduction of graph classes
* Monadic graphs and graph computation monad
* Graph implementation based on balanced (AVL) trees  
* Fast graph implementation based on IO arrays
* New algorithms:
  - Maximum flow
  - Articulation points
  - biconnected components
  - dominators
  - transitive closure
* minor changes in utility functions
  - changed signatures (swapped order of arguments) of 
    functions context and lab to be consistent with other graph functions
  - changed function first in RootPath: not existing path is now reported 
    as an empty list and will not produce an error
  - esp version that returns a list of labeled edges
    (to find minimum label in maxflow algorithm)
  - BFS uses amortized O(1) queue
  - Heap stores key and value separately
  - ...


March 2001
----------
* Changes to User Guide
* a couple of new functions
* some internal changes


April 2000
----------
* User Guide
* Systematic structure for all depth-first search functions
* Graph Voronoi diagram
* Several small changes and additions in utility functions


February 2000
-------------
* Representation for inward-directed trees
* Breadth-first search
* Dijkstra's algorithm
* Minimum-spanning-tree algorithm


August 1999
-----------
* First Haskell version
