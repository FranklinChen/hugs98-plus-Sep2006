#
# Project-specific version information.
#
# Note:
#   this config file is intended to centralise all
#   project version information. To bump up the version
#   info on your package, edit this file and recompile
#   all the dependents. This file lives in the source tree.

#
# Project settings:
# 
# ProjectVersion    is treated as a *string*
# ProjectVersionInt is treated as an *integer* (for cpp defines)

# Versioning scheme: A.B.C
#         A: major version, decimal, any number of digits
#         B: minor version, decimal, any number of digits
#	  C: patchlevel, one digit, omitted if zero.
#
# ProjectVersionInt does *not* contain the patchlevel (rationale: this
# figure is used for conditional compilations, and library interfaces
# etc. are not supposed to change between patchlevels).
#
# The ProjectVersionInt is included in interface files, and GHC
# checks that it's reading interface generated by the same ProjectVersion
# as itself. It does this even though interface file syntax may not 
# change between versions.  Rationale: calling conventions or other 
# random .o-file stuff might change even if the .hi syntax doesn't
