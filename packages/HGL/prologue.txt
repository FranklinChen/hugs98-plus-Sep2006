A simple graphics library, designed to give the programmer access to
most interesting parts of the Win32 Graphics Device Interface and X11
library without exposing the programmer to the pain and anguish
usually associated with using these interfaces.
/Note:/ the Win32 part is not currently operational.

The library also includes a module "Graphics.SOE" providing the interface
used in /The Haskell School of Expression/, by Paul Hudak,
cf <http://www.haskell.org/soe/>.
