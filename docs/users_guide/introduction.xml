<title>Introduction</title>

<para>
In September 1991, Mark Jones released a functional programming system called
<firstterm>Gofer</firstterm>, which provided a compact, portable implementation
of a Haskell-like language.
The system also included experimental type system extensions,
many of which later became part of Haskell.
On Valentine's Day 1995, Mark released
<firstterm>Hugs</firstterm> (Haskell User's Gofer System),
a derivative of Gofer with greater Haskell compliance.
Hugs versions are named after the version of Haskell they support;
Hugs 98 was released in January 1999.
Mark gave up the maintainership of Hugs in January 2000.
</para>

<para>
Hugs 98 still aims to be a fairly lightweight, portable implementation,
and now adheres closely to Haskell 98.
It also supports several extensions shared with other Haskell implementations:

<listitem>
<para>
Hugs supports standardized extensions (addenda) to Haskell 98,
for interfacing to foreign languages and structuring the module space.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
With the appropriate options (see <xref linkend="options-language"/>),
it is also possible to turn on a number of language extensions,
most of which are also supported by the
<ulink url="http://www.haskell.org/ghc/">Glasgow Haskell Compiler</ulink> (GHC),
though some are specific to Hugs.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
Hugs comes with a large collection of libraries,
also shared with other Haskell implementations,
and described in <ulink url="http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/libraries/">separate documentation</ulink>.
</para>
</listitem>

</itemizedlist>
Though these features make Hugs highly compatible with other implementations,
it is primarily intended as interpreter and programming environment
for developing Haskell programs.
If your application involves large programs or speed is critical,
you may strike Hugs's limitations, and may wish to try a Haskell compiler.

This was the definitive reference for earlier versions of Hugs,
though parts of it are now out-of-date.
Much of it remains relevant, particularly Section 7 on Hugs extensions,
and it should be consulted in several areas that this Guide does not cover well.

There are a number of mailing lists where people discuss Hugs and Haskell,
all with archives of past postings:
</para>

<variablelist>

<varlistentry>
<term><ulink url="http://www.haskell.org/mailman/listinfo/hugs-users">hugs-users</ulink></term>

<para>
This is the place for general discussion about using Hugs.

<term><ulink url="http://www.haskell.org/mailman/listinfo/hugs-bugs">hugs-bugs</ulink></term>
<listitem>
<para>
Use this list for reporting bugs.
This is more likely to be effective than direct mail to the authors
or maintainers of Hugs.
We do read this mailing list &ndash; but so do many other people,
who might be able to give you more appropriate or timely advice than us!
Before reporting a bug, check the list of known deviations from Haskell 98
(see <xref linkend="bugs-haskell98"/>).
