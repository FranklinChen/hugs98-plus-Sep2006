Description: A Haskell 98 interpreter
 Hugs is an interpreter for the non-strict, purely functional programming
 language Haskell.  This version of Hugs, Hugs 98, supports nearly all of
 the Haskell 98 specification, as well as a number of extensions.
 .
 The Haskell language is described by documents in the haskell-doc
 package.  Other libraries are documented in the ghc6-doc package.
