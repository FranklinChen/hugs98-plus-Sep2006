<center><h3><a name="what">What is cpphs?</a></h3></center>
<p>
<b>cpphs</b> is a liberalised re-implementation of
<a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-2.95.3/cpp.html">cpp</a>,
the C pre-processor, in <a href="http://haskell.org/">Haskell</a>.

<p>
Why re-implement cpp?  Rightly or wrongly, the C pre-processor is
widely used in Haskell source code.  It enables conditional compilation
for different compilers, different versions of the same compiler,
and different OS platforms.  It is also occasionally used for its
macro language, which can enable certain forms of platform-specific
detail-filling, such as the tedious boilerplate generation of instance
definitions and FFI declarations.  However, there are two problems with
cpp, aside from the obvious aesthetic ones:
<ul>
  <li> For some Haskell systems, notably Hugs on Windows, a true cpp
       is not available by default.
  <li> Even for the other Haskell systems, the common cpp provided by
       the gcc 3.x and 4.x series has changed subtly in ways that are
       incompatible with Haskell's syntax.  There have always been
       problems with, for instance, string gaps, and prime characters
       in identifiers.  These problems are only going to get worse.
</ul>
So, it seemed right to provide an alternative to cpp, both more
compatible with Haskell, and itself written in Haskell so that it
can be distributed with compilers.

<p>
This version of the C pre-processor is pretty-much feature-complete,
and compatible with the <tt>-traditional</tt> style.
It has two main modes:
<ul>
  <li> conditional compilation only (--nomacro),
  <li> and full macro-expansion (default).
</ul>
In <tt>--nomacro</tt> mode, cpphs performs only conditional
compilation actions, namely <tt>#include</tt>'s, <tt>#if</tt>'s,
and <tt>#ifdef</tt>'s are processed according to text-replacement
definitions (both command-line and internal), but no parameterised
macro expansion is performed.  In full compatibility mode (the
default), textual replacements and macro expansions are also processed
in the remaining body of non-cpp text.

<p>
Source language features:
<table border=0 align=center>
<tr><td>#ifdef</td>  <td>simple conditional compilation</td></tr>
<tr><td>#if</td>     <td>the full boolean language of defined(),
                     &amp;&amp;, ||, ==, etc.</td></tr>
<tr><td>#elif</td>   <td>chained conditionals</td></tr>
<tr><td>#define</td> <td>in-line definitions (text replacements and macros)</td></tr>
<tr><td>#undef</td>  <td>in-line revocation of definitions</td></tr>
<tr><td>#include</td><td>file inclusion</td></tr>
<tr><td>#line</td>   <td>line number directives</td></tr>
<tr><td>\\n</td>     <td>line continuations within all # directives</td></tr>
<tr><td>/**/</td>    <td>token catenation within a macro definition</td></tr>
<tr><td>##</td>      <td>ANSI-style token catenation</td></tr>
<tr><td>#</td>       <td>ANSI-style token stringisation</td></tr>
<tr><td>__FILE__</td><td>special text replacement for DIY error messages</td></tr>
<tr><td>__LINE__</td><td>special text replacement for DIY error messages</td></tr>
<tr><td>__DATE__</td><td>special text replacement</td></tr>
<tr><td>__TIME__</td><td>special text replacement</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
Macro expansion is recursive.  Redefinition of a macro name does not
generate a warning.  Macros can be defined on the command-line with
-D just like textual replacements.  Macro names are permitted to be
Haskell identifiers e.g. with the prime ' and backtick ` characters,
which is slightly looser than in C, but they still may not include
operator symbols.

<p>
Numbering of lines in the output is preserved so that any later
processor can give meaningful error messages.  When a file is
<tt>#include</tt>'d, cpphs inserts <tt>#line</tt> directives for the
same reason.  Numbering should be correct even in the presence of
line continuations.  If you don't want <tt>#line</tt> directives in
the final output, use the <tt>--noline</tt> option.

<p>
Any syntax error in a cpp directive gives a warning message to stderr.
Failure to find a #include'd file also produces a warning to stderr.  In
both cases, processing continues on the rest of the input.

<hr>
<center><h3><a name="how">How do I use it?</a></h3></center>
<p>
<center><pre>
Usage: cpphs  [ filename | -Dsym | -Dsym=val | -Ipath ]+  [-Ofile]
              [--nomacro|--noline|--strip|--text|--hashes|--layout|--unlit]*
       cpphs --version                                             
</pre></center>
<p>
You can give any number of filenames on the command-line.  If no
filename is given, cpphs reads from standard input.  The results are
catenated on standard output.  (Macro definitions in one file do not
carry over into the next.)

<p>
Options:
<table border=0 align=center>
<tr><td>-Dsym</td>
    <td>define a textual replacement (default value is 1)</td></tr>
<tr><td>-Dsym=val</td>
    <td>define a textual replacement with a specific value</td></tr>
<tr><td>-Dsym(args)=val</td>
    <td>define a macro with arguments</td></tr>
<tr><td>-Ipath</td>
    <td>add a directory to the search path for #include's</td></tr>
<tr><td>-Ofile</td>
    <td>specify a file for output (default is stdout)</td></tr>
<tr><td>--nomacro</td>
    <td>only process #ifdef's and #include's, do not expand macros</td></tr>
<tr><td>--noline</td>
    <td>remove #line droppings from the output</td></tr>
<tr><td>--strip</td>
    <td>convert C-style comments to whitespace, even outside
                      cpp directives</td></tr>
<tr><td>--hashes</td>
    <td>recognise the ANSI # stringise operator, and ## for
                      token catenation, within macros</td></tr>
<tr><td>--text</td>
    <td>treat input as plain text, not Haskell code</td></tr>
<tr><td>--layout</td>
    <td>preserve newlines within macro expansions</td></tr>
<tr><td>--unlit</td>
    <td>unlit literate source code</td></tr>
<tr><td>--version</td>
    <td>report version number of cpphs and stop</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
There are NO textual replacements defined by default.  (Normal cpp
usually has definitions for machine, OS, etc.  You can easily create
a wrapper script if you need these.) The search path is searched in
order of the -I options, except that the directory of the calling file,
then the current directory, are always searched first.  Again, there
is no default search path (unless you define one via a wrapper script).

<ul>
<li> Fixed the .cabal way of building cpphs.
<li> Update the --version reported (forgotten in 1.0, which still
     mistakenly reports 0.9).
<li> No longer throws an error on an empty file.
</ul>

<p>
cpphs-1.0, release date 2005.10.05<br>
By HTTP:
<a href="http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/fp/cpphs/cpphs-1.0.tar.gz">.tar.gz</a>,
<a href="http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/fp/cpphs/cpphs-1.0.zip">.zip</a>,
<ul>
<li> Included the <tt>cpphs.compat</tt> script for argument
     compatibility with the original <em>cpp</em>.
<li> Placed quotes around replacements for special macros __FILE__, __DATE__,
     and __TIME__.
<li> If no files are specified, read from stdin.
<li> Ignore #! lines (e.g. in scripts)
<li> Parse -D commandline options consistently with cpp,
     i.e. -Dfoo means foo=1
<li> Fix compatibility with preprocessors like hsc2hs, which use

     output with a warning to stderr.
</ul>

<p>
cpphs-0.9, release date 2005.03.17<br>

<a href="http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/fp/cpphs/cpphs-0.9.tar.gz">.tar.gz</a>,
<a href="http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/fp/cpphs/cpphs-0.9.zip">.zip</a>,

<a href="http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/fp/cpphs/cpphs-0.8.zip">.zip</a>,
<ul>

<li> Shuffled some source files around - there is now a runhugs script
     to invoke cpphs nicely.
</ul>

<ul>
<li> Enable the <tt>__FILE__</tt>, <tt>__LINE__</tt>, <tt>__DATE__</tt>,
     and <tt>__TIME__</tt> specials, which can be useful for creating

By HTTP:
<a href="http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/fp/cpphs/cpphs-0.6.tar.gz">.tar.gz</a>,
<a href="http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/fp/cpphs/cpphs-0.6.zip">.zip</a>,
<ul>
<li> Recognise and ignore the <tt>#pragma</tt> cpp directive.
<li> Fix beginning-of-file bug, where in <tt>--noline</tt> mode, a
     <tt>#line</tt> cpp directive appeared at the top of the output file.
<li> Fix chained parenthesised boolean exprs in <tt>#if</tt>, e.g.
        <pre>#if ( foo ) &amp;&amp; ( bar )</pre>
<li> Fix precedence in chained unparenthesised boolean exprs in
     <tt>#if</tt>, e.g.
        <pre>#if foo &amp;&amp; bar || baz &amp;&amp; frob</pre>
<li> For better compatibility with cpp, and because otherwise
     there are certain constructs that cannot be expressed, we no
     longer permit whitespace in a <tt>#define</tt> between the
     symbolname and an opening parenthesis, e.g.  
     <pre>#define f (f' id)</pre>.  Previously, this was interpreted
     as a parametrised macro, with arguments in the parens, and
     no expansion.  Now, the space indicates that this is a textual
     replacement, and the parenthesised expression is in fact the
     replacement.
</ul>

<p>
cpphs-0.5, release date 2004.06.07<br>
By HTTP:
<a href="http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/fp/cpphs/cpphs-0.5.tar.gz">.tar.gz</a>,
<a href="http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/fp/cpphs/cpphs-0.5.zip">.zip</a>,
<ul>
<li> Added a --version flag to report the version number.
<li> Renamed --stringise to --hashes, and use it to turn on ## catenation
     as well.
<li> Bugfix for <tt>#if 1</tt>, previously interpreted as false.
<li> Bugfix for --nolines: it no longer adds extra spurious newlines.
<li> File inclusion now looks in the directory of the calling file.
<li> Failure to find an include file is now merely a warning to stderr
     rather than an error.
<li> Added a --layout flag.  Previously, line continuations in a macro
     definition were always preserved in the output, permitting use
     of the Haskell layout rule even inside a macro.  The default is now
     to remove line continuations for conformance with cpp, but the option
     of using --layout is still possible.
</ul>

<p>
Initial release: implements conditional compilation and file inclusion only.


<p>
<b>Building instructions</b>
<p>
To build cpphs, use
<pre>    hmake cpphs [-package base]
</pre>
or
<pre>    ghc --make cpphs [-o cpphs]
</pre>
or
<pre>    mv cpphs.hugs cpphs	# a simple runhugs script
</pre>

<p>
You will notice that the command-line arguments for <em>cpphs</em>
are not the same as for the original <em>cpp</em>.  If you want
to use <em>cpphs</em> as a completely drop-in replacement for
the real <em>cpp</em>, that is, to accept the same arguments, and
have broadly the same behaviour in response to them, then edit the
<tt>cpphs.compat</tt> script to point to the installed location of
<em>cpphs</em>, then use this script instead of <em>cpp</em>, e.g.
<pre>
    ghc -cpp -pgmPcpphs.compat
</pre>


<hr>
<center><h3><a name="diff">Differences from cpp</a></h3></center>
<p>
In general, cpphs is based on the <tt>-traditional</tt> behaviour, not
ANSI C, and has the following main differences from the standard cpp.

<p>
<b>General</b>
<ul>
<li> The <tt>#</tt> that introduces any cpp directive must be in the first
     column of a line (whereas ANSI permits whitespace before the <tt>#</tt>).
<li> Generates the <tt>#line n "filename"</tt> syntax, not the <tt># n
     "filename"</tt> variant.
<li> C comments are only removed from within cpp directives.  They are
     not stripped from other text.  Consider for instance that in
     Haskell, all of the following are valid operator symbols:  <tt>/*
     */  */*</tt>   However, you can turn on C-comment removal with the
     <tt>--strip</tt> option.
<li> Macros are never expanded within Haskell comments, strings,
     or character constants, unless you give the <tt>--text</tt> option to
     disable lexing the input as Haskell.
<li> Macros are always expanded recursively, unlike ANSI, which detects
     and prevents self-recursion.  For instance, <tt>#define foo x:foo</tt>
     expands <tt>foo</tt> once only to <tt>x:foo</tt> in ANSI, but in cpphs
     it becomes an infinite list <tt>x:x:x:x:...</tt>, i.e. cpphs does not
     terminate.
</ul>
<p>
<b>Macro definition language</b>
<ul>
<li> Accepts <tt>/**/</tt> for token-pasting in a macro definition.
     However, <tt>/* */</tt> (with any text between the open/close
     comment) inserts whitespace.
<li> The ANSI <tt>##</tt> token-pasting operator is available with
     the <tt>--hashes</tt> flag.  This is to avoid misinterpreting
     any valid Haskell operator of the same name.
<li> Replaces a macro formal parameter with the actual, even inside a
     string (double or single quoted).  This is -traditional behaviour,
     not supported in ANSI.
<li> Recognises the <tt>#</tt> stringisation operator in a macro
     definition only if you use the <tt>--hashes</tt> option.  (It is
     an ANSI addition, only needed because quoted stringisation (above)
     is prohibited by ANSI.)
<li> Preserves whitespace within a textual replacement definition
     exactly (modulo newlines), but leading and trailing space is eliminated.
<li> Preserves whitespace within a macro definition (and trailing it)
     exactly (modulo newlines), but leading space is eliminated.
<li> Preserves whitespace within macro call arguments exactly
     (including newlines), but leading and trailing space is eliminated.
<li> With the <tt>--layout</tt> option, line continuations in a textual
     replacement or macro definition are preserved as line-breaks in the
     macro call.  (Useful for layout-sensitive code in Haskell.)
</ul>

<center><h3><a name="library">cpphs as a library</a></h3></center>
<p>
You can use cpphs as a library from within a Haskell program.  The main
interface is in <tt>Language.Preprocessor.Cpphs</tt>.  Haddock
documentation is <a href="cpphs/">here</a>.  To make the library
available to your haskell compiler, you must install the cpphs package
using Cabal.
