This directory contains 'cpphs', a simplified re-implementation of cpp,
the C pre-processor, in Haskell.

TO BUILD
--------
Just use
    hmake cpphs [-package base]
or
    ghc --make cpphs [-o cpphs]		#  -o needed for ghc <= 6.4.1 ]
or
    runhugs cpphs	# or rename the script cpphs.hugs to cpphs


USAGE
-----
	cpphs  [filename | -Dsym | -Dsym=val | -Ipath]+  [-Ofile]
               [--nomacro|--noline|--strip|--text|--hashes|--layout|--unlit]*

For fuller details, see docs/index.html

If you want to use cpphs as a completely drop-in replacement for the
real cpp, that is, to accept the same arguments, and have broadly
the same behaviour in response to them, then edit the "cpphs.compat"
script to point to the installed location of cpphs, then use this
script instead of cpp, e.g.
    ghc -cpp -pgmP cpphs.compat
