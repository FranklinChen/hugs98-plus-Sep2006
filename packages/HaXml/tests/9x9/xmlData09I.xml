<!-- Attempt to break lexer module

If the parser attempts to look beyond the first token, 
the lexer may attempt to evaluate (tail []).  Currently,
the parser stops with the first token.

Cf. Lex.hs:

xmlAny w p ('>':ss) = emit TokAnyClose p:       xmlAny (tail w) (addcol 1 p) ss

and other expressions nearby that evaluate tail w.
