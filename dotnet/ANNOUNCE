			   Hugs98 for .NET

A new version of Hugs98 for .NET is now available, sporting the
following:

 * A version of the popular Haskell interpreter, 
   Hugs98 (http://haskell.org/hugs), targetted at the Microsoft
   .NET platform. 
 * .NET interop integrated via the Haskell FFI.
 * Support for wrapping up Haskell functions as .NET classes /
   delegators, providing any .NET language with the ability
   to call and use Haskell.

The distribution comes with documentation and examples demonstrating
how to access and interact with .NET -- all available via the
Hugs98.NET homepage:
