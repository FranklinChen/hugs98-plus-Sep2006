-- | Specification of the way the vertices given during 'renderPrimitive' are
-- interpreted. In the description of the constructors, /n/ is an integer count
-- starting at one, and /N/ is the total number of vertices specified.

data PrimitiveMode =
     Points
     -- ^ Treats each vertex as a single point. Vertex /n/ defines point /n/.
     -- /N/ points are drawn.
   | Lines
     -- ^ Treats each pair of vertices as an independent line segment. Vertices
     -- 2/n/-1 and 2/n/ define line /n/. /N/\/2 lines are drawn.
   | LineLoop
     -- ^ Draws a connected group of line segments from the first vertex to the
     -- last, then back to the first. Vertices /n/ and /n/+1 define line /n/.
     -- The last line, however, is defined by vertices /N/ and 1. /N/ lines
     -- are drawn.
   | LineStrip
     -- ^ Draws a connected group of line  segments from the first vertex to the
     -- last. Vertices /n/ and /n/+1 define line /n/. /N/-1 lines are drawn.
   | Triangles
     -- ^ Treats each triplet of vertices as an independent triangle. Vertices
     -- /3n-2/, /3n-1/, and /3n/ define triangle /n/. /N\/3/ triangles are drawn.
   | TriangleStrip
     -- ^ Draws a connected group of triangles. One triangle is defined for each
     -- vertex presented after the first two vertices. For odd /n/, vertices
     -- /n/, /n/+1, and /n/+2 define triangle /n/. For even /n/, vertices /n/+1,
     -- /n/, and /n/+2 define triangle /n/. /N/-2 triangles are drawn.
   | TriangleFan
     -- ^ Draws a connected group of triangles. One triangle is defined for each
     -- vertex presented after the first two vertices. Vertices 1, /n/+1, and
     -- /n/+2 define triangle /n/. /N/-2 triangles are drawn.
   | Quads
     -- ^ Treats each group of four vertices as an independent quadrilateral.
     -- Vertices 4/n/-3, 4/n/-2, 4/n/-1, and 4/n/ define quadrilateral /n/.
     -- /N/\/4 quadrilaterals are drawn.
   | QuadStrip
     -- ^ Draws a connected group of quadrilaterals. One quadrilateral is
     --defined for each pair of vertices presented after the first pair.
     -- Vertices 2/n/-1, 2/n/, 2/n/+2, and 2/n/+1 define quadrilateral /n/.
     -- /N/\/2-1 quadrilaterals are drawn. Note that the order in which vertices
     -- are used to construct a quadrilateral from strip data is different from
     -- that used with independent data.
   | Polygon
     -- ^ Draws a single, convex polygon. Vertices 1 through /N/ define this
     -- polygon.
