<para>
The <literal>DirectoryExts</literal> module follows the footstep of
other '<literal>Exts</literal>' modules and provides functionality
that goes beyond what the Haskell 98 module
<literal>Directory</literal> offers. That is, functionality that
provides access to file/directory operations in an OS-independent
manner.
</para>


<para>
<literal>DirectoryExts</literal> currently exports the following:
</para>

<para>
<programlisting>
copyFile  :: FilePath -&#62; FilePath -&#62; IO ()
</programlisting>

<para>
Notes:

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>
<function>copyFile</function> lets you copy a file to another
non-existent file.
</para>

<para>
File copying is done external to Haskell, and is for natural
reasons quicker as a result and, most importantly, file copying
handles the number of the OS-specific error conditions that might
arise as a result of trying to perform the file copy operation.
</para>

<para>
Should the file copying operation for some reason not succeed, the
action <function>copyFile</function> raises an IO exception to
signal the fact.
